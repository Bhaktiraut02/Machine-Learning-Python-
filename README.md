# Machine Learning using Python
### Exploratary Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data. It is used to find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques. Following things are part of EDA:
-	Get maximum insights from a data set
-	Uncover underlying structure
-	Extract important variables from the dataset
-	Detect outliers and anomalies (if any)
-	Test underlying assumptions
-	Determine the optimal factor settings

The main purpose of EDA is to detect any errors, outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the data. It allows Analysts to understand the data better before making any assumptions.

Data Analysis [EDA] involves the following brief steps:
1.	**Import libraries and load dataset**

2.	**Check for missing values:**
Missing data can be handled by two methods, Removing data and Imputation

3.	**Visualizing the missing values:**
With the help of heat map, we can see the amount of data that is missing from the attribute. With this, we can make decisions whether to drop these missing values or to replace them. Usually dropping the missing values is not advisable but sometimes it may be helpful too.

4.	**Replacing the missing values:**

### Exploratory data analysis tools
Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.
Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable you’re looking at.

**Multivariate visualizations**, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.

**K-means Clustering** is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data points are assigned into K groups, i.e. the number of clusters, based on the distance from each group’s centroid. The data points closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category. K-means Clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.
Predictive models, such as 
**linear regression**, use statistics and data to predict outcomes.
