### Exploratary Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data. It is used to find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques. Following things are part of EDA:
-	Get maximum insights from a data set
-	Uncover underlying structure
-	Extract important variables from the dataset
-	Detect outliers and anomalies (if any)
-	Test underlying assumptions
-	Determine the optimal factor settings

The main purpose of EDA is to detect any errors, outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the data. It allows Analysts to understand the data better before making any assumptions.

Data Analysis [EDA] involves the following brief steps:
1.	Import libraries and load dataset
